# GWJ Userscipts

A collection of scripts for enhancing the forum experience on [GamersWithJobs.com](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/) written by me (Cathadan) and others as credited in each file.

## Scripts

All tested and working with the new site design:

* `GWJUserRename.user.js` - Make a user on the forums appear to have a different username, just for fun.
* `GWJignore.user.js` - Put users on your ignore list to keep their posts from displaying

Not yet updated for the new site design:

* `GWJthreadignore.user.js` - Put a thread on your ignore list to keep it appearing in topic lists
* `GWJhidepnc.user.js` - Hide all P&C threads (partially functional, might not be updatable)

Unnecessary with the new site design:

* `disableEditorShortcuts.user.js` - Disable the keyboard shortcuts in the post composition box to avoid the bugs that sometimes insert tags while typing

## Installation

1. Install a userscript extension in your browser. ([Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in Chrome)
2. Browse to the script you want to install.
3. Click the "Raw" button in the top right.
4. Your userscript extension should take over and offer to install the script for you.
